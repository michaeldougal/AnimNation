[dependencies]
# Most dependencies will look like this.
#
# The name on the left is an alias. It defines what name we would like to
# use to refer to this package.
#
# The value on the right will usually be a string of the form
#   "SCOPE/NAME@VERSION_REQ"
# Versions are SemVer version requirements. The default behavior matches
# Cargo, or npm with the `^` version specifier.

[server-dependencies]
# Dependencies in the server realm can be required here as shown above.
# These are dependencies which should only ever exist on the server.

[dev-dependencies]
# Dev dependencies can be server or shared but are only needed during development.
